# Basic Android Project 
Made By: Muhammad Fida Raditya.

This is the first time I'm using Android Studio, the first project are trying all the basic Android Development elements from the project's structure.

## Found Some Difficulties:
- I use ```androidx.appcompat.widget.AppCompatButton``` instead of ```Button``` widget, it affects on the click animation,
- Went trying to create a 'Hold' animation after clicking 'Daftar' button, but the Dialog box wont hold and just quickly went back to 'Login' page,
- Trying to create an API package, but everytime the function get called, the emulator just crashed.
